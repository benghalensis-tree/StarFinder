The reason why it is Mag 4 is because the building lights are not strong enough to light the whole street/sky.,two lights located on the second floor and the entrance. The second floor light emits a stronger orange glow light that shines across the street. It uses some sort of orange flood light bulb.  The entrance light emits a softer glow that only reaches a foot away from the source of light. It uses a incandescent light bulb.    Combined the light emitted is at 50% and are the only lights on currently. The 3 street lights across the street (which are LED ) are off.
